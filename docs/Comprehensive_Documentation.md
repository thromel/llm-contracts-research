# Comprehensive Documentation for LLM Contracts Research

## Introduction

This project is a comprehensive research tool for analyzing and understanding contracts using state-of-the-art language models. It is designed to integrate advanced contract analysis, provide clear examples and testing, and support research in the domain of legal contracts.

## Features

- **Contract Analysis**: Leverages language models for smart contract analysis and legal research.
- **Data Handling**: Efficiently processes large datasets of contracts and associated metadata.
- **Modular Design**: Organized code structure with clear separation of concerns (e.g., src for core logic, tests for automated testing, docs for documentation, data for input/output, and papers for research articles).
- **Testing Framework**: Includes a robust suite of tests to validate functionality and ensure reliability.
- **Extensibility**: Easily extendable structure to incorporate new analytical models, data sources, and contract types.

## Architecture

The project is structured into several key components:

- **src/**: Contains the core implementation of the project, including algorithms for contract analysis and integration with language models.
- **docs/**: Houses all documentation files. This file serves as a comprehensive guide, and additional docs in this folder provide more specific guidelines and analysis details (e.g., guidelines_claude_new_contracts.md and analysis_system.md).
- **tests/**: Contains test cases and scripts to ensure the integrity and reliability of the core functionalities.
- **data/**: Stores input datasets and output results relevant to the contract analyses.
- **papers/**: A repository for research papers and related documentation that informed and justify the project design.

The architecture is designed to facilitate clear separation of concerns, maintainability, and scalability. Each directory plays a specific role in the project's lifecycle, from development to deployment.

## Examples

Below are some usage examples to help you get started:

### Running Contract Analysis

To analyze a contract document, use the provided script. For example:

```
python run_context_extractor.py --input data/sample_contract.txt --output output.txt
```

This command processes the contract text from the specified input file and writes the analysis results to the output file.

### Running Tests

The project includes a suite of automated tests. To execute the tests, run:

```
pytest tests/
```

This command runs the test suite to validate various components of the project.

## Additional Information

For more detailed guidelines, please refer to:
- **Contributor Guidelines**: Review docs/guidelines_claude_new_contracts.md for coding standards and contribution procedures.
- **System Analysis**: Refer to docs/analysis_system.md for an in-depth look at the system architecture and analytical components.

We welcome feedback, contributions, and suggestions to continuously improve this project.
