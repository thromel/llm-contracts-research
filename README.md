A comprehensive research pipeline for analyzing LLM API contract violations in GitHub issues and Stack Overflow posts. Implements a 6-stage methodology with high-quality data acquisition, multi-modal screening, and comprehensive comment analysis.

## 🎯 **Current Status: FULLY FUNCTIONAL & ENHANCED** ✅

The pipeline is **working and tested** with intelligent data filtering and enhanced screening:
- ✅ **Quality-Focused Data Acquisition**: Only closed GitHub issues and answered Stack Overflow questions with comments
- ✅ **Comment-Aware Analysis**: LLM screening considers both original content and community comments
- ✅ **Multi-Modal Screening**: Traditional (DeepSeek/GPT-4), Agentic (LangChain), and Hybrid approaches
- ✅ **Production-Ready Pipeline**: End-to-end processing with comprehensive error handling
- ✅ **Provenance Tracking**: Full audit trail of data transformations

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. **Environment Setup**

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd llm-contracts-research

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements-agentic.txt

# Set up environment variables
cp config.env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys and MongoDB URI
```

### 2. **Run Complete Pipeline**

```bash
# Run full pipeline with all steps
python run_pipeline.py

# Run specific steps
python run_pipeline.py --step acquisition   # Data acquisition only
python run_pipeline.py --step filtering     # Keyword filtering only  
python run_pipeline.py --step screening     # LLM screening only
python run_pipeline.py --stats-only         # Show current statistics
```

### 3. **Configure Screening Mode**

```bash
# Traditional screening (OpenAI GPT-4 only)
export SCREENING_MODE=traditional

# Agentic screening (Multi-agent LangChain)
export SCREENING_MODE=agentic

# Hybrid (both traditional and agentic for comparison)
export SCREENING_MODE=hybrid
```

## 📊 **Enhanced Data Acquisition Strategy**

### **Quality-Focused Filtering**

The pipeline now implements **intelligent data selection** to maximize research value:

#### **GitHub Issues**
- ✅ **Only Closed Issues**: Focus on resolved problems with confirmed outcomes
- ✅ **Comments Required**: Ensures community discussion and additional context
- ✅ **Multi-Repository Coverage**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google AI, LangChain, etc.
- ✅ **Comment Integration**: Full comment threads included in analysis

#### **Stack Overflow Questions**  
- ✅ **Answered Questions Only**: Focus on problems with verified solutions
- ✅ **Comments Required**: Ensures meaningful community engagement
- ✅ **Target Tags**: `openai-api`, `langchain` - high-quality LLM-specific content
- ✅ **Comment Integration**: All comments included for comprehensive context

### **Enhanced Content Analysis**

    D --> E[Contract Violation Detection]
    E --> F[Evidence Validation]
    F --> G[Final Decision]
```

## 🧠 **Multi-Modal LLM Screening**

### **Traditional Mode (High Performance)**
- **Bulk Screening**: DeepSeek-R1 for high-throughput processing
- **Borderline Analysis**: GPT-4 for detailed edge case examination
- **Comment-Aware**: Analyzes original content + all comments together
- **Fallback Support**: Uses GPT-4 for all posts if DeepSeek unavailable

### **Agentic Mode (High Quality)**
- **Contract Detector**: Specialized agent for API violation identification
- **Technical Analyst**: Deep technical error analysis
- **Relevance Judge**: LLM-specific content validation
- **Decision Synthesizer**: Multi-factor decision integration
- **Comment Processing**: Each agent considers full comment context

### **Hybrid Mode (Research Quality)**
- **Parallel Processing**: Both traditional and agentic on same dataset
- **Comparison Metrics**: Performance and accuracy analysis
- **Quality Validation**: Cross-validation between approaches

## 📈 **Research-Based Prompt System**

All screening modes use **empirically-grounded prompts** with comment analysis:

- **📊 Comment Integration**: Prompts explicitly instruct models to analyze community responses
- **🎯 Evidence Hierarchy**: 5-level classification system considering both original posts and comments
- **📁 Context Awareness**: Distinguishes between original problem and community solutions
- **🔄 Follow-up Analysis**: Tracks problem resolution through comment threads

**Enhanced Prompt Features:**
- Community validation signals from comments
- Expert feedback identification in comment threads
- Solution verification through accepted answers
- Problem clarification through follow-up discussions
