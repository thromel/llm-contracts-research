EXPERT ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK:

## EVIDENCE HIERARCHY (Rate evidence strength 1-5):

### Level 5 Evidence (Definitive Violations):
- Direct API error responses with specific codes and messages
- Exact parameter values shown to violate documented limits
- Complete code examples demonstrating contract violations
- Step-by-step reproduction of contract violation scenarios
- Official error documentation references

### Level 4 Evidence (Strong Violations):
- Clear error descriptions matching known contract patterns
- Specific technical details about failed API calls
- Well-documented workarounds for contract limitations
- Multiple community confirmations of the same issue
- Integration framework errors caused by API contracts

### Level 3 Evidence (Moderate Violations):  
- Technical discussions of API limitations with some specifics
- Partial code examples showing potential contract issues
- Error messages without full context but clear API relation
- Community discussions of best practices to avoid violations
- Performance issues clearly tied to contract parameters

### Level 2 Evidence (Weak Violations):
- Vague references to API problems without specifics
- General discussions of API behavior without clear violations
- Incomplete error descriptions that might be contract-related
- Speculation about API limitations without evidence
- Mixed technical discussions with some relevant content

### Level 1 Evidence (Insufficient):
- No specific technical details about API usage
- General programming questions without API focus
- Installation/setup issues unrelated to API contracts
- Conceptual discussions without practical implementation
- Off-topic content with minimal API relevance

## DETAILED CONTRACT ANALYSIS:

Examine the post for these specific patterns based on your research taxonomy:

### Parameter Constraint Violations:
- Are specific parameter names and values mentioned?
- Do the values fall outside documented API limits?
- Is there evidence of parameter validation errors?
- Are there discussions of parameter combinations that fail?

### Rate Limiting Violations:
- Are HTTP status codes 429 or rate limit messages mentioned?
- Is there evidence of request frequency issues?
- Are there discussions of quota or billing limitations?
- Is there mention of throttling or backoff strategies?

### Content Policy Violations:
- Are safety filters or content moderation mentioned?
- Is there evidence of prompt rejection or output filtering?
- Are there discussions of content policy compliance?
- Is there mention of harmful content detection?

### Format Violations:
- Are JSON parsing errors or schema validation failures mentioned?
- Is there evidence of message format issues?
- Are function calling or tool use problems described?
- Is there mention of response format mismatches?

### Context Length Violations:
- Are token limits or context length errors mentioned?
- Is there evidence of conversation truncation issues?
- Are there discussions of prompt size optimization?
- Is there mention of model-specific context limits?

### Authentication Violations:
- Are API key errors or authentication failures mentioned?
- Is there evidence of permission or access issues?
- Are there discussions of billing or subscription problems?
- Is there mention of organization-level restrictions?

COMPARISON FRAMEWORK:

Compare this post against these validated contract violation patterns:

### Established Positive Patterns:
1. "InvalidRequestError: max_tokens must be â‰¤ 4096" - Parameter constraint violation
2. "RateLimitError: Rate limit reached for requests" - Rate limiting violation  
3. "This request has been flagged as potentially violating our usage policy" - Content policy violation
4. "JSONDecodeError: Could not parse LLM output" - Format violation
5. "ContextLengthExceededError: Maximum context length exceeded" - Context length violation

### Established Negative Patterns:
1. "How do I install the openai library?" - Installation question
2. "Why is GPT-4 not as accurate as expected?" - Quality complaint
3. "What's the difference between GPT-3 and GPT-4?" - Conceptual question
4. "Can you help me debug this Python error?" - General programming
