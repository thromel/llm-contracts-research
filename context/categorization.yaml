    Temporal_Order:
      - Always                 # The ordering must hold at all execution points.
      - Eventually             # The required ordering must be satisfied at some point in execution.
      
  Hybrid:
    SAM_AMO_Interdependency:
      - SAM_Level_3_And_AMO_Level_2  # Combined violations where behavioral (SAM) and temporal (AMO) rules interdepend.
    Selection:
      - SAM_Level_3            # Violation resolved by satisfying the SAM (behavioral) constraint.
      - AMO_Level_2            # Violation resolved by satisfying the AMO (temporal) constraint.
      - Combination_of_SAM_and_AMO   # Cases where both behavioral and temporal contracts must be jointly satisfied.
