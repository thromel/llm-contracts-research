incorrect_tensor_shape:
  description: 'The matmul() API from TensorFlow requires that both of the arguments
    should be a Tensor with one of the following types: float16, float32, float64,
    int32, complex64, complex128. Supplying arguments of different types leads to
    a type error and program crash.'
  type: input_validation_violation
  severity: high
  impact: Program crashes with a type error.
missing_preprocessing_step:
  description: For the Scikit-learn API linear_model.SGDClassifier, partial_fit()
    requires the data provided as arguments to be shuffled. Failure to shuffle the
    data leads to incorrect model training.
  type: preprocessing_violation
  severity: medium
  impact: Leads to incorrect model training due to unshuffled data.
inadequate_activation_function:
  description: Using categorical_crossentropy as the loss function in Keras requires
    a softmax activation in the final layer. Omitting softmax activation results in
    model training errors.
  type: model_configuration_violation
  severity: medium
  impact: Results in model training errors due to incorrect loss function configuration.
unmatched_input_dimensions:
  description: In TensorFlow, the decode() method expects a byte string as input.
    Supplying an input of a different type or format results in a runtime error.
  type: input_validation_violation
  severity: high
  impact: Causes a runtime error due to type mismatch.
missing_method_order:
  description: In TensorFlow, calling tf.wholeFileReader() must be followed by tf.train.start_queue_runners()
    to avoid hanging. Failure to follow this order results in the program hanging.
  type: method_order_violation
  severity: high
  impact: Program hangs waiting for input due to missing method call order.
