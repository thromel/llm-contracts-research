severity_criteria:
  system_crash:
    severity: High
    description: "Results in complete system failure. This violation causes an abrupt termination of the application, rendering the system inoperable."
    recommendation: "Implement rigorous precondition checks and fallback mechanisms to prevent complete crashes. Use automated testing to detect such failures early."
  
  performance_degradation:
    severity: Medium
    description: "Impacts system performance but does not cause a full failure. The violation leads to slower response times or increased resource usage."
    recommendation: "Optimize the affected code paths and consider performance profiling to identify and address bottlenecks."
  
  data_corruption:
    severity: High
    description: "Causes incorrect data processing or storage, potentially leading to wrong system behavior or data loss. This violation affects data integrity and consistency."
    recommendation: "Implement validation checks and redundancy measures (e.g., checksums, transaction logging) to detect and recover from data corruption events."
  
  hang:
    severity: Medium
    description: "Causes the system to become unresponsive, requiring a restart or manual intervention. Although the system does not crash, the interruption can significantly impact user experience."
    recommendation: "Utilize timeouts and watchdog timers to detect and recover from hangs, and improve error logging to diagnose the root cause."
  
  incorrect_functionality:
    severity: High
    description: "Leads to incorrect system behavior, producing wrong outputs or failing to complete tasks as intended. This can compromise the correctness of the system's results."
    recommendation: "Enhance unit testing and integration tests with clear functional requirements. Consider formal verification for critical components."
  
  memory_out_of_bound:
    severity: High
    description: "Causes the system to exceed its allocated memory, potentially leading to crashes or severe instability. This violation can quickly escalate under heavy workloads."
    recommendation: "Apply memory profiling and static analysis tools to detect leaks and over-allocation, and enforce strict resource limits where possible."
  
  unknown:
    severity: Low
    description: "The impact of the violation is unclear or not immediately apparent. Further investigation is needed to determine the severity and potential impact."
    recommendation: "Monitor the system closely and collect additional diagnostic information to clarify the impact. Use exploratory testing to uncover hidden issues."
